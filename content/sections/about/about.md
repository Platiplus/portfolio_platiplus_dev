My name is Victor Rosa, and I've been developing software for the past eight years. I specialize in
<span style="color: #F0DB4F;">Javascript</span> and
<span style="color: #1ABAA2;">Typescript</span>, and I've always been passionate about creating web applications that solve real-world problems. 

Over the years, I've worked with various front-end and back-end frameworks, such as 
<span style="color: #61DBFB;">React</span>,
<span style="color: #B52E31;">Angular</span>,
<span style="color: #68A063;">Node.js</span>, 
<span style="color: #CC0000;">Ruby on Rails</span>, 
<span style="color: #005DA6;">dotNet</span>,
to name a few. I've also worked with various databases and cloud services, including
<span style="color: #F29111;">MySQL</span>,
<span style="color: #7A7EA1;">PostgreSQL</span>,
<span style="color: #4DB33D;">MongoDB</span>,
<span style="color: #FF9900;">AWS</span>,
<span style="color: #13C8E5;">Azure Devops</span>.

As my skills and experience grew, I started to take on more senior roles. I became a team leader and was responsible for leading the development of complex web applications. I developed a passion for coaching and mentoring younger developers and found great satisfaction in seeing them grow and succeed. I also became more involved in the open-source community, contributing to various projects.
